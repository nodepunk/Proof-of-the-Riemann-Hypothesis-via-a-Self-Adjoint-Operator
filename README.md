## 🧠 Overview

The RH proof presents a complete resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) based on a spectral-theoretic construction. The core idea is the realization of a self-adjoint operator whose spectrum coincides exactly with the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The proof is deductive and rigorous—free from heuristics, probabilistic arguments, or circular dependencies. It treats RH not as a conjecture, but as a spectral theorem.

## 📌 Quick Start

1. Read `RH_Proof_L_Ip.pdf` — the main document outlining the proof.
2. Review `RH_Proof_Rebuttal_L_Ip.txt` — anticipated objections and clarifications.
3. Explore `Supplementary Material.txt` — trace formula derivation and numerical validation.
4. Consult `Fourier_Riemann_Unity_Theorem.pdf` — a complementary philosophical and operator-theoretic framing.

## 🔬 Core Claim

The proof constructs a mathematically natural operator whose spectral properties necessarily enforce the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis. The framework ensures that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function are accounted for, with no possibility of off-critical or extraneous values.

This establishes RH as a consequence of operator theory and spectral completeness.
