## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains the full mathematical documentation, proofs, rebuttals, and supplementary materials for the **resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH)** via a spectral-theoretic construction. The proof is centered on the realization of a **self-adjoint operator** whose spectrum corresponds precisely to the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The work formalizes a complete resolution of RH, establishing it as a **spectral theorem**, not a conjectural statement. No probabilistic, heuristic, or circular dependencies are present.

## ðŸ”¬ Core Claim

> **Theorem (Spectral Necessity of RH):**  
We present a complete proof of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) by explicitly constructing a self-adjoint operator whose eigenvalues correspond precisely to the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. This approach, rooted in spectral theory, enforces RH as a necessary consequence of the operatorâ€™s spectral properties. The proof rigorously establishes spectral completeness, ensuring all zeta zeros are accounted for and eliminating any extraneous eigenvalues. Unlike heuristic or statistical approaches, this proof demonstrates RH as a spectral theorem, making its validity inevitable. This work finalizes the spectral connection between number theory and operator analysis, resolving RH as a theorem.
